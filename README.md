# SpaceX-Falcon9-Cost-Predictor
This repo was used for the completion of my "IBM: Applied Data Science Capstone" project where I created a model for predicting whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lands successfully or not. Using this prediction we can determine the cost of a SpaceX Falcone 9 launch.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the actual cost of a launch. This information will be especially useful for SpaceX competitors as they can use it to understand SpaceX's competitive strength.
